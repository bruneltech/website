# Techsoc Website

The website for the society.
Gatsby.js is used for the frontend and Wordpress is used for the backend.

How future committees approach deployment of this website and other society-affiliated ones is up to them. Be warned, dedicated infra isn't cheap but we're
getting away with putting society stuff on a $20 DigitalOcean instance (4GB RAM / 2 Cores). 

Shared hosting providers are typically much less than this however you will be sacrificing some control, flexibility (and likely performance) over a VPS solution. I haven't used a shared hosting provider in years however, so i'm not sure what the situation is like with react-based sites and them.


## Deployment
> TODO: deal with this later
